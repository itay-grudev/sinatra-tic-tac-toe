Sinatra Tic Tac Toe
===================

A friend told me that his homework was to implement a Tic Tac Toe game with Sinatra.
My response was that this is easy and I can do it for less than an hour.
Here is the proof. : )

P.S. It took me more than an hour, but just because I wanted to make it fancy.

Usage
-----

Just run either:
```
./tic-tac-toe
```
or:
```
ruby tic-tac-toe.rb
```

Optionally there is a development mode which usess ```Sinatra::Reloader``` to automatically reload files upon chages. You can invoke it by passing the ```dev``` like:
```
ruby tic-tac-toe.rb dev
# or
./tic-tac-toe dev
```
